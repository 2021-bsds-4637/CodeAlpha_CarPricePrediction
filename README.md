# 🚗 Car Price Prediction 

This project aims to predict the price of a car based on various features such as brand, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and engine power. Using machine learning algorithms, the notebook provides a step-by-step pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains:
- Car name & company
- Year of manufacture
- Fuel type (Petrol, Diesel, etc.)
- Transmission (Manual, Automatic)
- Engine & mileage details
- Selling price

## 🧠 ML Pipeline Overview

The notebook follows this process:

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handling null values, duplicates, and invalid entries
   - Converting string-based numbers to numeric format

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extracting car brand and model
   - Encoding categorical features

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Correlation matrix
   - Distribution plots for price, mileage, year, etc.

4. **Model Building**
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Evaluation using RMSE, R² Score

5. **Prediction & Interpretation**
   - Predict car prices based on new inputs
